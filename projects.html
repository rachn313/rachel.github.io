    <h8>Froodie</h8>
    <p class="projCat">Hackathon Project</p>
    <p class="projYear">2017</p>
    <p class="projSpec"> <br /> <br /> This web application, Froodie, was designed with three fellow Wellesley women (Jun Ru, Marinn, Sandra) for Wackathon, Wellesley's anual hackathon. A portmanteau word I created, combining "free" and "foodie" together, Froodie was born. Froodie was designed to leviate food waste, and give access to free food for those who need it or want it. Users can input a food location or search the latest food submissions. This website was live for about a year with a free domain name. Our team won "best-food related hack" and "best domain name" awards. <br /> <br /> I worked primarily front-end, using HTML, CSS, and Canva for graphic design elements. <br /> <br /> If we ever were to implement this application for real world use, I think we would create an ios/ android application for use on college campuses as a pilot project. </p>

    <h9>Quanitifying favorable interactions between Buforin II and DNA</h9>
    <p class="projCat">Computational Chemistry Lab</p>
    <p class="projYear">2018</p>
    <p class="projSpec">In order to understand cellular processes that regulate all life, we must study how molecules recognize and interact with each other in the complex cellular environment. By learning more about these important molecular interactions, scientists can develop more potent drugs that improve quality of life. Cells are highly crowded environments, with up to 40% of the cellsâ€™ total volume occupied by macromolecules. Many computational and experimental studies, however, treat biomolecular interactions as if they happen in dilute solution, without accounting for their complex environment. Studies have shown that macromolecular crowding affects molecular interactions. This study aims to create and evaluate multiple computational models for the cellular environment. The specific interacting model system we are using is Buforin II (BF2), an antimicrobial peptide (AMP) that binds to bacterial DNA, disrupting intracellular processes that are essential for cell survival. We use computational methods to study how different crowding models influence the binding between BF2 and DNA. Analyses conducted thus far show that crowding creates a more favorable interaction between BF2 and DNA. In addition to developing and evaluating models to efficiently and accurately model the complex cellular environment, our study will provide further insight into developing stronger antimicrobial peptides to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria. <br /> <br /> I used Python, iOS terminal to store data and submit jobs to the CPU prossessers that live on campus (named Iron, Fluorine, Chlorine, and Calcium). I also learned some MATLAB features to visualize the data. <br /> <br /> I will continue conducting research in the lab, calcuting the interactions of different model environments this Fall. In the spring, I hope to create a project that partners with Wellesley's Human Computer Interaction lab to create an AR/VR program to visual molecules for educational and research use.</p>
