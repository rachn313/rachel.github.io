        <h1>About Me: Rachel Navarrette</h1>
        <div id="introduction">
        <br /> <br /> 
        <p1>My name is Rachel Navarrette. I attend Wellesley College, prospective computer science major. I am currently in my second year at Wellesley College. I am taking CS230: Data Structures with Java, MATH225: Discrete Mathematics, PSYC101: Introduction to Psychology, ENG203: Short Narrative. During the academic year, I conduct research in a computational chemistry lab, junior system administrator for the lab, and co-treasure and co-costume for Ascendance, a dance organization, on campus. </p1>

        <h7> Facts about me!</h7>
        <br /> <br />
        <p2> I have two brothers, we are triplets! I love to read books and draw when I get the chance. Another passion of mine is photography. I mostly shoot digital nowadays, but throughout high school I experimented with analog photography classes, using traditional black and white film, and color film. Recently, I started dabbling with polaroid photography as well. I prefer tropical weather (despite living in cold weather areas all my life). I'm a true "foodie" at heart. I love strawberry cake, and pretty much every dessert on the planet! I also love trying new cuisines, and expiriencing different cultures when traveling.</p2>
        <p9> I am caring, motivated, open-minded, and passionate. I have strong work ethics and I am accountable for my work. I like to plan events in advance and I enjoy collaborating with others. I am not afraid to ask questions and present new ideas. I am open to constructive feedback, striving to grow, improve and learn new things. 
        </p9>
        <h3>Why computer science?</h3>
        <p3>I have always been fascinated by technology. I feel that given my age, I have been lucky to experience how fast technology has changed over the years. From watching movies via VHS tapes to using touch screens on a cell phone and tablet, to experiencing virtual and augmented reality, technology has impacted and improved our life. I enjoy learning and using programming languages as a vessel to solve problems.  It amazes me how the computer programs work so efficiently to solve equations or perform jobs. My current computer science interests include machine-learning, artificial intelligence, security, and Augmented/Virtual reality.
